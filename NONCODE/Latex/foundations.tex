\section{Transformers}
okay here we go lets talk about transformers.
The transformer is a deep learning model for natural language processing. Opposed to other TYPE models like recurrent and convolutional neural network models, transformers solely make use of the Attention mechanism.

\subsection{Attention}
The attention mechanism assigns a weight to every previous DATAPOINT which enables the model to recognize the important data
