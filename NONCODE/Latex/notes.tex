\chapter{Notes}

This is just to track my progress.


i want to use py2cfg and write my own converter to json. all of the info is there, it is just utilized differently. I can do this using their info and creating my own json file depending on their info.
how early in the processing chain can I access the info of the cfg? as early as possible as i dont want to include any info of the visualization.

try first: print ast and see what looks like/type of file/ input


tree.fields =  ('body', 'type\_ignores') (tuple, both type str)

cfgentryblock.get\_source() in builder.build gives me the actual line of code so can base on that.

need next: \newline
way to iterate through code  \newline
find children and edges

line 387 in model. py handles edges in the visualization. not sure if theyre decided earlier or later.

can see edges being used in cfg cleanup so edges must exist beforehand hence i dont have to work with visualization. 
 
next step. find out how to convert info you get into json file? what style is json file again?
can the edges be translated into children of nodes of json?
do we use the type for json file? like "for" and "if" etc
