\section{Control Flow Graph}
Using Abstract Syntax Trees to train a transformer model, rather than plain code files shows to improve results greatly. [source?] This is due to additional structural information contained in the Abstract Syntax Tree. This ensures there is no ambiguity when processing the code. [...more explanation]

However, Abstract Syntax Trees are not the only option for this code completion problem. Control Flow Graphs provide more structural information that could be utilized to further improve the score of this code completion task.




\section{Building the CFG file from py2cfg}
In order to compare the use of control flow graph (CFG) data to that of Abstract syntax trees we first need to generate the CFG data in a way that is processable. In Marcel's work, the data is fed into the transformer as a json-file containing a list for each body of code.
